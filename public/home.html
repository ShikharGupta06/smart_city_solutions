            <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>You have probably heard of both smart and sustainable cities, and, most likely,
                you cannot tell the difference right away. So, you may be surprised to discover 
                that there are quite a few differences between sustainable and smart cities. 
                Smart cities are usually those which are full of innovative information and 
                communication technology around the city services. At the same time, sustainable
                cities are those with the main focus on air, water, and sewage pollution control, 
                connectivity, and low road pollution emissions. Sustainable cities must have e-government 
                and citizen-based solutions and use eco-friendly building materials. There is no doubt that
                a sustainable city has developed city infrastructure, advanced programs for urban development,
                and other digital-related stuff but smart sustainable cities are more about a combination of
                both concepts in one. <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Understanding Sustainable and Smart cities</span><br>
                Before taking a look at the differences between smart and sustainable cities, it is necessary to 
                understand the essence of each notion. Smart city frameworks are developing at a crazy speed and the 
                line between smart and sustainable cities starts to erase. In fact, we realize that urbanization has real 
                social and economic sustainability potential in the world and smart city development can contribute to 
                the improvement of citizens’ quality of life. Urbanization is viewed as a bunch of opportunities. 
                This inevitably contributes toward developing smart urban areas which provide good planned urban 
                peripheral areas. We need to make smart cities evolve out of existing cities and thereby we have a new 
                smart city concept in mind. At the same time, we should remember environmental sustainability, the
                necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address urban sustainability assessment frameworks. 
                That is why the goal should be to take the road to urban renewal and to adopt ecologically responsible
                measures, ensuring that the city becomes economically robust and economically viable. <br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sustainable Cities</span><br>
                A sustainable city is a city that is socially oriented, focused on social and economic aspects, and
                accessible to all. Major cities, globally, are doing their best to be sustainable and make it real for 
                environmental indicators measuring environmental sustainability and economic growth to work in one 
                direction. These cities are inclusive of all people and deal with the economic, social, and environmental
                impacts of the development process. The term sustainable city is a mashup of the terms, which include high
                quality of life, advanced waste management, and urban sustainability. In this regard, sustainable cities
                become those, which can provide citizens with the best city services while keeping up with being green 
                and inclusive.<br><br>
                A sustainable city is any city whose objective is to improve climate change and the quality of living 
                among residents. Quality is usually measured by urban sustainability assessment frameworks and used to 
                evaluate the achievement of smart city goals. Sustainable cities usually focus more on policy and 
                physical initiatives like green spaces, public infrastructures, architecture, communities, streets, and 
                public spaces. IoT and smart cities technology together with smart city planning usually come in handy in
                such scenarios. IoT platform for smart cities can reshape modern cities and make them more feasible, 
                which make the integration of smart city initiatives necessary for sustainability.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sustainable Cities = Degrowth Cities</span><br>
                Despite their name, degrowth cities are not necessarily devoid of construction or ones which are 
                approaching the destruction. In fact, construction is a central part of sustainable cities, as existing
                cities consume finite space. However, the most viable solution to replace old housing stock is renovation. 
                In this regard, degrowth cities have several advantages. <br><br>
                <li>They showcase a variety of sustainable practices, focusing on renewable and recyclable materials.</li><br>
                Smart sustainable cities avoid materials that require high energy consumption for transport or transformation. This results in a healthier environment for residents, as well as a lower carbon footprint. This concept is essential in reversing global climate change, and cities that are degrowth and sustainable are imperative to achieve this goal. Sustainable smart cities are those which can preserve a healthy urban environment for present and future generations.<br><br>
                <li>Aside from reducing emissions and increasing efficiency, degrowth cities also focus on social, economic, and environmental goals.</li><br>
                Digital transformation is a huge change, especially if we talk about the whole city. That is why it is of utmost importance for sustainable smart city performance to satisfy residents’ needs in order to be not only full of modern technologies but also really useful. The city of Copenhagen, for instance, has a bicycle-friendly population: nearly half of its residents commute by bike. As a response to that, the city is developing superhighways, with bicycle lanes, traffic lights, and safer intersections. Electric vehicles (EVs) produce zero carbon emissions and have become a necessity in cities that have achieved carbon neutrality as well, which can in a way contribute to economic development as more “green-oriented” companies will invest in smart city IoT architecture.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Smart Sustainable Cities are Accessible</span><br>
                Inclusion is key for a sustainable city. People with disabilities and older people make up over 25 percent of the world’s population (United Nations, n.d.). By 2050, this number will grow to over two billion people (United Nations, n.d.). Considering the indicated statistics projections, adapting urban services and environments for the disabled and aged is one of the highest sustainability goals. The world’s major cities with developed economies have already started analyzing urban sustainability and doing everything to integrate more IoT applications for smart cities, which creates a sustainable environment. However, it is not always easy to establish urban sustainability frameworks, which work. This is because people with disabilities face barriers and limitations that other people may not notice and some of the countries in the developing stage simply cannot afford this stuff. That is why, developing smart city frameworks, cities should consider the price and the actual opportunity to make it real.<br><br>
                By making cities accessible to people with disabilities, everyone will experience inclusion. One way to achieve accessibility is to remove architectural barriers and make public spaces more accessible. This also involves taking into account the needs of socioeconomically vulnerable groups. For example, accessible sidewalks and pavements are vital for wheelchair users. However, as we already noted, to make a sustainable IoT-based smart city, you need some money and support. So, self-sufficiency and resilient financing arrangements are essential for developing new tools and pathways.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sustainable Cities are Social</span><br>
                Social inclusion and sustainable cities go hand in hand. The Journal of Social Inclusion publishes studies on fair, green, and inclusive cities, which are the hallmarks of socially sustainable cities (Short, 2021). Economic revitalization requires the inclusion of people of all backgrounds and income levels, as well as the creation of inclusive public spaces.<br><br>
                Social differences are often mapped onto political power relations and social status. These differences are sites of power and subordination and are never simply biologically determined. These differences are often contested and embraced by communities and individuals and reflected in cities. Social diversity is fundamental to human flourishing and it is always considered in sustainable city frameworks.<br><br>
                In order to achieve the goal of sustainable cities, sustainable development must take place in all aspects of a city’s daily life, including the social dimensions. These include gender equity, economics, culture, built environment, and policy. For example, UNIDO believes that gender equality promotes economic participation by women (UNIDO, 2020). Gender equality has proven to lead to lower poverty incidence rates, which makes it important to ensure gender equity in urban planning and policy.<br><br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; ">Sustainable Smart Cities are Healthy</span><br>
                By incorporating renewable energy technologies into daily life, sustainable cities are able to minimize health impacts due to climate change and pollution. Cities are ideally located in areas where they can maximize energy efficiency and reduce their dependence on non-renewable sources. By reducing energy use, improving air quality, and using sustainable transportation and housing, cities can reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and improve the quality of life, actually becoming more sustainable.<br>
